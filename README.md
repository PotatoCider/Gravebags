# Plugin Description

A gravestone mod plugin for TShock mediumcore players. 

This plugin is intended for multiplayer mediumcore playthroughs which regularly hit the item drop cap when there are >400 items on the ground.

Server Side Characters is recommended for more convienent inventory management.

# Features

- Mediumcore players will now drop a gravebag on death instead of exploding into a million items
- Gravebags contain all the items dropped upon death and will automatically fill your inventory when picked up (with/without SSC)
- SSC players have the added benefit of retaining the location of the items in the inventory.
- Leftover items in the bag will not be picked up if your inventory is full.

# Warning
- Gravebags may be lost after server restart (thereby losing your dropped items).
- You may encounter some bugs, if so, please let me know on Discord (PotatoCider#9092)

- [ ] Add a way for other players to pick up other player's gravebags
